## Version 2.0.0.0 2022-05-18

Compatible with OpenSearch 2.0.0

### Features
OpenSearch 2.0.0 is the first official release with OpenSearch Notifications.

Notifications consist of three plugins, `notifications-core` and `notifications` backend plugins for OpenSearch, and a `notificationsDashboards` frontend plugin for OpenSearch Dashboards.

Use Notifications to manage your notification channel configurations in a centralized location and send messages to these channels.

This release also adds notification-specific REST APIs for CRUD operations on channels and internal transport APIs for integrating/communicating with other plugins.
